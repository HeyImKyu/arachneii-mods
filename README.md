# Center Hook
An api/hook to add center cards (card back, joker, voucher, booster pack, editions, card type, consumable cards) to the game.

**DOES NOT** add the functionality of the card, just adds the card and necessary data to all the places it needs to be. 

See mods/c_bezos.lua for an example of how to implement a consumeable card.

# Quick Restart
Quickly reroll ante 1 tags by clicking f2.

**DOES NOT** work on any ante other than ante 1 by default. 

You may remove the ante 1 restriction for your own installation if you wish.
